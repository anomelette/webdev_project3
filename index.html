        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>My name is Amelie and I am a 3rd year at IIT majoring in ITM and Cyber Forensics and Security.

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>In my free time I like to listen to music and read. Some of my favorite books that I've read are:</p>
        <ul class="hobby-list">
          <li>A Winter's Promise Quartet by Christelle Dabos</li>
          <li>Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen</li>
          <li>Howl's Moving Castle by Diane Wynne Jones</li>
          <li>The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle</li>
        </ul>
        <p>One of my favorite pastimes is watching movies. My top 5 movies are:</p>
        <ol class="hobby-list">
          <li>The Pianist</li>
          <li>10 Things I Hate About You</li>
          <li>Princess Bride</li>
          <li>Spirited Away</li>
          <li>Grave of Fireflies</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Fun fact: I was named after a movie! The french film Amelie, i.e. my namesake, was released in 2001 and won many awards internationally. It was also 
        nominated for Academy Awards for Best International Feature Film and Best Cinematography, amongst several other categories.</p>            
        <p>I also like to play piano. In fact, I've played for over 15 years! Here's one of my first recitals:</p>

        <p>Sadly, ever since I quit lessons 3 years ago, I've lost some of my skills. On the brightside, I can finally grow out my nails.</p>
